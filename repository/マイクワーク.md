# マイクワーク

**マイクワーク** – maikuwāku; lit. **micwork**. There’s no proper translation for it but it refers to the switching of actors between mics in a booth during recording. Because booths can’t always accommodate one mic per actor or because there are too many actors in one booth, actors would have to coordinate among themselves and silently move to and from the mics without getting in the way of each other or holding up a mic when they don’t need it.

It’s a skill that isn’t usually taught in schools but is very essential in keeping a smooth flow during recording. Many things are taken into account such as importance of role, height of actor, length of consecutive lines, distance from seat to mic, seniority, etc. You often hear rookie *seiyuu* talk about this as one of the things they learn on the fly and praise other *seiyuu* for.
