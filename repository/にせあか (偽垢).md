# 偽垢

**偽垢** – _niseaka_. Phonetic kanji [ニセ (**_nise_**) + アカウント (**_aka_**_unto_)] used to refer to **fake social media accounts**. Cases involving fake accounts tend to be cleared by the actual person in many ways: Addressing the issue and proclaiming themselves to be the real one, posting a picture/selfie that can’t be found anywhere else, referencing an event or anecdote that gets confirmed by someone close to them. The agency may also address the matter directly on their official account to clear any misunderstandings.
