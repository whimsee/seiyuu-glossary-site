# 脇役

**脇役** – *wakiyaku*. **supporting role**. A character with a larger role than a minor character but is not the main focus of the story. Some anime are accompanied with a radio show that functions as promotion. If the *seiyuu* with the lead role is too busy to be its main personality, it usually goes to the one with the supporting role, who is often less experienced or less popular.
