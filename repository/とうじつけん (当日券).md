# 当日券

**当日券** – *tōjitsu-ken*. **day-of ticket** or **same-day ticket**. Tickets that are still available on the day because the event didn’t fully sell out, tickets were cancelled, or *kankeisha* seats were released. Sometimes they’ll set up less-than-ideal seats to accommodate or they’ll open standing-only spots. You have to line up early  for these as they are issued first-come-first-serve. The amount you pay is usually advertised, it tends to be a little more expensive than the cheapest option, and it’s cash-only. If the number of people lined up for *tōjitsuken* exceeds the number of tickets available, staff might raffle them out instead.

In my experience with a reading drama, you have to wait outside until they open a line for these tickets, which you have to keep an eye on. They will let persons with tickets in first before counting the number of people who lined up to determine if they have to raffle them. In my case, they didn’t. I paid cash as it was the only option, and I even got to pick a seat at the edge of the venue but near the stage which wasn’t too bad at all since I got a clear view of the actors.
