# 公式

**公式** – *kōshiki*. **Official** or **handled by an official body** such a talent agency or a record label. Important to note for SNS accounts because they are run primarily by management with the *seiyuu* or artist either posting with a clear indication that it’s them via square brackets ([@KAJI_staff](https://twitter.com/kaji_staff)‘s The post starts with 【梶】 to indicate that the post is by **Yuki Kaji** himself) or they don’t post there at all because they have their own personal account ([@MaayaUchida](https://twitter.com/maayauchida) is a staff account of **Maaya Uchida** while [@maaya_taso](https://twitter.com/maaya_taso) is her personal account). Some official accounts may also double as personal accounts (Yoshimasa Hosoya’s [@bokudake369](https://twitter.com/bokudake369) is technically an account for his program but he also uses it to promote his other works and replies to fans even in English – speaking from experience).

Official accounts don’t usually cover everything and they may even be late at breaking news, but what is posted there is considered legitimate especially when emergency notices are concerned.
