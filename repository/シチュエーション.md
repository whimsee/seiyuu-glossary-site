# シチュエーション

**シチュエーション** – *shichuēshon*. lit. **situation**, **premise**, or **scenario**. You often encounter this in program or event segments where they act out a situation, often the kind that gets them to do something cute and/or embarrassing. These are essentially ad-lib so they’re free to do anything creative as long as it is entertaining.  
  
This may also refer to scenarios done for [Situation CDs](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%81%E3%83%A5%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3Cd), which can range from mundane to extraordinary.
