# アニソン

**アニソン** – *anison*. **Anime songs** or **anisong** are theme songs, insert songs, or character/image songs and background music that are primarily used for anime series and franchises. As such, it not only applies to TV anime and movies, but also games, drama CDs, even sound effects. It’s a genre and subculture in its own right which will be touched upon but not fully discussed here.
