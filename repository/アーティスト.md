# アーティスト

**アーティスト** – *ātisuto*. **Artist**, **singer**, or **musician**. A *seiyuu* who ventures into musical endeavors also go by this title, mostly for PR purposes as they’ve made their “artist debut.”   
  
The distinction is important because there are seiyuu and idols who don’t call themselves “artists” or otherwise debut as one. That’s because an アーティスト is considered a musical talent; they are expected to be good (or at least better than average) at singing; that’s their bread and butter. Idols and seiyuu are more like entertainers, and that comes with different expectations (ie. they dance, play the crowd, etc).
