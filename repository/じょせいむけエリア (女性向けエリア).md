# 女性向けエリア

**女性向けエリア** – *joseimuke-eria*. **women’s section**. It is a portion of the audience area reserved for women. These are usually done for smaller venues such as live houses and halls, and they are usually located in “good spots” that have a clear view of the stage, some even right in front of it, although the space and location varies per show. These are special accommodations requested by the organizer or the artist as an effort to create a friendlier and more comfortable atmosphere for female fans, especially first-timers in idol concerts, and possibly grow their female fanbase so these spots tend to have cheaper ticket prices as well. In this context, the **general audience area** is called *ippan-eria* (一般エリア).

There are two types:

1. **Strictly women-only** (女性限定エリア; *joseigentei-eria*) which has marshalls posted to keep men out; you might also see this as *joseisenyō-eria* (女性専用エリア).

2. **Priority women’s section** (女性優先エリア; *joseiyūsen-eria*) which are spaces presented as women’s sections but can still be occupied by men.
