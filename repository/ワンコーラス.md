# ワンコーラス

**ワンコーラス**– _wankōrasu_. lit. **one chorus**. As the term implies, it refers to **singing a song from the beginning until the end of the first chorus**. This is often used in singing sessions such as karaoke. More importantly, this is used in singing auditions where you need to prepare a song with that specification since you only have one chance to showcase your vocal skill and there are many applicants. As such, some songs are out of the question because they’re too long (ideal length is 30 seconds to 1 minute) or they don’t produce a good impact to the judges who you’re trying to impress. This also means one has to sing their own way, not just mimic the singing of the original singer.
