# メイクアップアーティスト

**メイクアップアーティスト** – _meikuappu ātisuto_. **make-up artist**. You may also encounter this as **_meiku-san_** (メイクさん) or **_heameiku_** (ヘアメイク; lit. hair and make-up). They are professionally trained specialists who are responsible for making the artist look nice and presentable through cosmetics and hairstyles. In behind the scenes content, you will often see them carrying a bag while retouching or fixing the hair of the artist. Because a lot of the time spent by an artist is in the dressing room, some of their anecdotes are about their make-up artist coaching them on best practices and recommendations.

::: warning
I can’t fully substantiate this (there’s a pattern but I’m not sure if it’s a thing across the industry) so I’ll note it here. Some make-up artists follow their client across completely different projects, from events to video shoots. This usually happens when they’ve established a good working relationship with them. This might also be a source of connections since some are managed by an agency or they are well-connected.
