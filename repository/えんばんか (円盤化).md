# 円盤化

**円盤化** – _enbanka_. Mostly found in announcements as it refers to performances that will be **released in DVD/BD format** as a way to reach a wider audience and earn more revenue. Most concerts, stage plays, and some reading dramas are recorded to an extent (audio recording, phone video, panoramic video, or an actual camera) so they can be reviewed, kept for archives, released as LV/DV, or used for future promotions. They may not be as comprehensive as the ones used for DVD/BD releases but the larger the venue, the higher the chance it gets recorded. The cost of the DVD/BD is arbitrary as a DVD release may cost as much as a BD especially if it’s the only format, and a BD can get very expensive even though it only contains one video.

::: info
If you’re at an event and you want to make a good guess if it will get a DVD/BD release, check for camera setups, how many they are, and where. You may also look at the performers and notice if they are gesturing to cameras.
