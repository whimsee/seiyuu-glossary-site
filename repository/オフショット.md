# オフショット

**オフショット** – _ofushotto_. lit. off shot. Refers to **pictures taken behind-the-scenes** that are not included with the official product. These could be pictures taken during breaks, off-angle shots done during production, or simply a sneak peek of the production process itself. **_Making_** (メイキング; _meikingu_) is a term you’ll often find used for videos of this type but it can be used for photos as well.
