# メディアミックス

**メディアミックス** – *media mikkusu*. **Media mix** is an advertising strategy characterized by its use of varied and related media channels in order to appeal to its target audience more effectively. A media property that utilizes this strategy is typically called a franchise. For example, the Pokemon franchise started as a game and is now recognized as one of the biggest in the world thanks to the anime, competitive card game, toys, apps, crossovers, etc., all of which cater to their fans in one way or another, often at multiple angles.

On a smaller scale, a media mix franchise can simply be a theater production with a limited manga print run. Fans of the stage play who might want to know more of the story are encouraged to buy the manga. Depending on how it does, the franchise might start branching out into anime or games, or it could stick to where it feels it could perform best and do more stage plays and manga.

A *seiyuu*’s level of involvement in these activities may range from doing character songs, to voicing for crossovers and adaptations, to hosting programs and events.
