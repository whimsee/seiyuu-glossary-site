# サイン会

**サイン会** – _sain-kai_. In **signing events**, the celebrity will sign the item you bought in front of you. You may be asked to choose where to sign and there is generally no personalization due to time constraints. You may also talk to them while they are signing which lasts for about 10 seconds.
