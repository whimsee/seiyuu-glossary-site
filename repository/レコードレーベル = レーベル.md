# レコードレーベル = レーベル

**レコードレーベル** | **レーベル** – *rekōdo rēberu* | *rēberu*. **record label**. Often shortened to **label**, they essentially function the same way as they do in the West in that they are responsible for the marketing, distribution, copyright protection, promotion, publishing, even production of music and music videos. Their role as producer is of note because many major labels employ a roster of musicians and dancers that you will come to recognize if you watch enough live concerts or go over credits of music produced by them. 

Because they have a specialized set of operations and a base of connections different from a *seiyuu* agency, a *seiyuu* pursuing a musical career is normally managed by a record label. They also scout for talent, hold auditions, and some even partner with other agencies to find talent that they can market as both singer and *seiyuu* (more often as groups) because of the significant and growing overlap between their markets.
