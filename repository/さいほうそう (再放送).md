# 再放送

**再放送** – _saihōsō_. **rebroadcast** or **rerun**. This is usually done for radio shows because archive recordings are not the norm, however that is slowly starting to change with some shows officially uploading them to YouTube with better audio-quality (currently, for a limited time). This also applies to anime when they get rebroadcast in TV studios and streaming services.

You might also encounter this is as **_ripiito-hōsō_** (レピート放送; lit. repeat broadcast).
