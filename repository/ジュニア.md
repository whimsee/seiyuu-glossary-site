# ジュニア

**ジュニア** – *jiyunia*. **junior**. It is essentially a title officially used by certain agencies to refer to new talent. Since they are starting out and generally don’t have much work yet, they usually introduce themselves to managers and senior talent per company culture. 

This is different from being a **kōhai** (後輩; junior or more specifically, someone who debuted later than them) in the sense that one can graduate from junior status but will be forever be a *kōhai* to their **senpai** (先輩; senior or more specifically, someone who debuted earlier than them).
