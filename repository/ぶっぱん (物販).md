# 物販

**物販** – *buppan*. Refers to **general** **sale of goods** through an official outlet. It’s a broad term that covers not only brick-and-mortar stores and event booths for concerts, but also online purchases (see [*tsūhan*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%86%E3%81%AF%E3%82%93%20%28%E9%80%9A%E8%B2%A9%29)).

For events, there are two types of merchandise booths: Indoor booths that open once they let people enter the venue (these require a ticket), and outdoor booths that become available several hours before the gates open (no ticket required). Regardless of type, they usually stay open up to 30 minutes to an hour after the main event ends. It is first-come first-serve so if they run out of stock, that will be it unless it’s a multi-day event where it will be restocked the next day. This makes it quite a bloodbath for popular items since they can sell out in minutes.

It is possible that there are people who buy in bulk with the intent to resell at a later time for profit. This is why some event organizers enforce purchase limits (ie, five items per transaction. If you want more, you have to line up all over again). Some events may also open for orders online post-event. For events with planned DVD releases, some venues offer on-site pre-orders. You will need a Japanese address to avail of this.
