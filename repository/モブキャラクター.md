# モブキャラクター

**モブキャラクター** – *mobu kyarakutā*. **mob character** or **bit role**. Often unnamed (Girl A, Villager B, etc.), it is a voiced role that is considered filler or extra. However, while small roles like these are usually cast by less recognized *seiyuu* (or by more popular ones for whatever reason), these roles can open new opportunities for them because of the people they meet or connect with, and the impression they make with the production staff.
