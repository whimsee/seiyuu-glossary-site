# 渡し会

**渡し会** – _watashi-kai_. These are **meet-and-greet** **events** where you can interact with the celebrity for 10 seconds or until the staff tells you to move along. These brief interactions are normally expressions of support and event impressions (which are encouraged) but you may also ask questions that the celebrity might answer. Some interactions might leave such an impression that they will talk about it in other places such as MCs and programs. Individual sessions tend to be fan-reported on social media. 

As one might expect, there are regulars who come to these events every chance they get and they get recognized to the point that some of their reports read like extensions of a previous interaction.
