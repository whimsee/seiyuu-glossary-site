# トロッコ

**トロッコ** – *torokko*. **cart**. Often utilized in large venues, it is a method of transportation using moving platforms to ferry performers from one place to another or simply to get them closer to the audience, especially those at the back. These are normally done as gimmicks during songs where the performer gets on a cart that is moved from point to point by a crew of people in time with the song until the performer gets off it. Variations of the concept exist such as a balloon flying over the audience, even an automated platform.

Anecdotes say that performing on carts takes some getting used to as they are completely reliant on their in-ear monitor to guide them through the performance because sound delay (as well as other distractions such as multiple sound sources) becomes more apparent the farther you are from the stage.

As someone who was seated at the far end of the Saitama Super Arena as carts moved past, the delay between seeing the performer’s mouth move and actually hearing them through the speakers from the stage is about a second.
