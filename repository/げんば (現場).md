# 現場

**現場** – *genba*. Literally, this means the place or location. Contextually, it means **workplace** or any location where work is done, such as a studio, a live stage, even an off-site shoot for a variety show. You’ll often read interviews or hear people use this word to refer to where they met so-and-so or did this-and-that, with no further explanation. 

You may also encounter the colloquial *asagenba* (朝現場) and this refers to **work in the morning**, which tends to be 10AM and earlier.
