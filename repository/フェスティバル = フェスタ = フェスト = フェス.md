# フェスティバル = フェスタ = フェスト = フェス

**フェスティバル** | **フェスタ** | **フェスト** | **フェス** - *fesutibaru* | *fesuta* | *fesuto* | *fesu*.  Lit. **festival** | **festa** | **fest** | **fes**.  You might also see this being described as **FESTA-type events** because they involve more than one act or guest. This does not just cover concerts because most *seiyuu* events that don’t involve any singing are generally classified as festa as well. These events also tend to be social spaces for the performers since most rarely get to meet and interact with each other otherwise. In fact, collaborations have been born solely due to festa interactions. This does not apply to events like WonderFes and JumpFes, even though it’s in the name, as they are more convention-type events.
