# 養成所

**養成所** – *yōseijo*. This specifically refers to **training schools** managed by a talent agency. While these require passing an audition (or otherwise more strict admission processes compared to [*senmon-gakkō*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93%E3%82%82%E3%82%93%E3%81%8C%E3%81%A3%E3%81%93%E3%81%86%20%28%E5%B0%82%E9%96%80%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%29)), it provides a kind of freedom and access to connections that *seiyuu* schools normally don’t have. Training hours are shorter and students usually have a more flexible schedule as they are not expected to take lessons every day and they have options for evening and weekend sessions, giving them space to attend them while working or studying. They also get more practical experience, chances to learn from veterans affiliated with the industry, as well as different opportunities to break into the industry particularly with agencies with connections to theater and other fields. And after graduating, which may take 6 months to 2 years, they become affiliated with the agency in a semi or full capacity.
