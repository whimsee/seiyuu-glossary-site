# スタイリスト

**スタイリスト** – *sutairisuto*. **Stylists** are in-charge of creating a signature look for the artist. This involves matching attire for the theme and function, and coordinating with staff (art director, make-up artist, camera crew, etc.) and their needs. They are also responsible for procuring, preparing, maintaining, and returning materials and outfits used in a shoot. Being as stylist as one doesn’t necessarily require a professional background but some may belong to an agency or work as freelancers.
