# イントネーション - 音調  - 抑揚

**イントネーション** | **音調**  | **抑揚**  – *intonēshon* | *onshō* | *yokuyō*. **intonation**. Refers to variations in the pattern of spoken pitch which reflect emotion, intent, attitude, even the content of the words spoken. It also denotes character information such as their origin because intonation differs across accents, dialects, and nationalities.  
  
It is part of a seiyuu’s arsenal, where slight changes in intonation can be enough to produce a completely different character. They may sometimes use accent references or guides give them an idea of the sound they have to produce.
