# セットリスト - セトリ

**セットリスト** | **セトリ** – *settorisuto* | *setori*. **set list**. Sequence of songs played during a concert. These can range from short sets of 2-5 songs for festa-type events to an entire gauntlet of 25 or more for solo concerts. Who decides the songs is case-by-case: Some groups don’t really have a say at first or are given leeway with some required songs. Established artists may have free rein that they can tweak depending on the expected audience especially for overseas concerts. 

::: info
For those who write down setlists, the general syntax is “Xn” where n is the order in a sequence and it can be omitted. X is replaced with: M for main songs, MC for talk segments, EN for encore songs, WEN for double encore, TEN for triple encore. Each have their own count so three songs with an MC in the middle and a single encore song can be written as “M1. M2. MC. M3. EN.”
