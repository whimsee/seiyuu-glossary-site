# 限定版

**限定版** – _gentei-ban_. **limited edition** or **limited item**. This refers to items supposedly sold in limited quantities so they may also be labelled special or collectors’ editions. They are more expensive because they include *tokuten* such as DVDs/BDs with behind the scenes or live concert recordings (audio-only or with video), **autographed** (サイン入り; *sain-iri*) items, bromides, keychains and other trinkets, etc.

For CDs, you might see 限定盤 (*gentei-ban*) instead.
