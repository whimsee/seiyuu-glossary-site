# パーソナリティー

**パーソナリティー**  – *pāsonariti*. **personality** or **host**. Originally a radio broadcasting term, this refers to the star of the show. They carry the show from start to finish, interact with **guests** (ゲスト; *gesuto*), and make things interesting and memorable for the listeners or viewers. 

A program usually features one or two main personalities. If they’re permanent, the title of the show is usually named after them, sometimes in punny ways (ie. *Takahashi Rie | Ueda Reina shigoto de aenai kara rajio wa hajimemashita*, *Saito Soma | Ishikawa Kaito no dame janai rajio*, *Komada Wataru K-WAVE Radio*). 

For solo personalities, they may invite a **temporary co-host** or **assistant** (アシスタント; *ashisutanto*) as a way to spice things up. For programs that feature a group, it may be a rotating roster instead, with members taking turns as personality or guest. These shows in particular are interesting to watch because of the dynamics that come with the role and the relationship between the members who appear in it.
