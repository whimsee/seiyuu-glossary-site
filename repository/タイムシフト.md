# タイムシフト

**タイムシフト** – **Time Shift** or **TS**. A Nico Nico-specific feature that allows one to replay a live stream after it has finished broadcasting (if available) for a limited time. It is essentially an archive without edits since channels normally upload properly edited archive videos that are available as long as the channel exists.  
  
Some ticketed programs allow their time shift to be viewable indefinitely if you bought the ticket for it.
