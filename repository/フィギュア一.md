# フィギュア一

**フィギュア一** - *figyuā*. **Model figures** are made of plastic, PVC, polyurethane resin, ABS, or metal. They come in different types, from actual scale models to small figurines. Some have static poses while some are articulate and modular. They are usually hand painted. Different manufacturers brand their figure products with names such as Nendroid, Figma, ALTAiR, Chibi Kyun-Chara, Creator×Creator, Ichiban Kuji, DXF (Define x Figure), etc.

They are considered collectors’ items because a lot of them are released in limited quantities. Some of them can only be acquired through crane games.
