# 報告

**報告** – _hōkoku_. **report**. You might also see this in katakana as レポート (_repōto_). With the amount of events that take place every week, some of which are sold out with high demand, reports are one way to relay what happened. Beat reporters from official publications normally gain special access to events, and you can usually expect them to do a good job of relaying highlights, choice quotes, announcements, even setlists if it’s a concert. Some reports are published online, some become feature pieces in magazines.

Fans also write unofficial reports and publish them in blogs or as twitter threads. They’re useful because they go into detail about specific moments (even spoilers) and contain personal commentary you wouldn’t find in official reports. It also provides another perspective of events which is great for cross-referencing.

Reports may also come as part of announcements in social media and these posts are characterized as lengthy writeups (presented as images or threads) detailing the situation, causes, and actions taken.
