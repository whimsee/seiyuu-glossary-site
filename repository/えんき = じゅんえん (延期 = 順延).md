# 延期 = 順延

**延期** | **順延** – *enki* | *jun’en*. **postponement**. Events may also get postponed for the same reasons they get cancelled, however this comes with the promise of it being moved to a different date. In fact, some cancellations are implicit postponements because it’s quite possible the event will be rescheduled but time and circumstances might make it hard to say anything more as they will be held accountable.
