# サブユニット = ミニユニット = 派生ユニット

**サブユニット** | **ミニユニット** | **派生ユニット** – *sabu-yunitto* | *mini-yunitto* | *hasei-yunitto*. These essentially refer to **subunits** or **subgroups** made up of members within a primary unit or adjacent to it (related to them in their world). You’ll find this more often with the larger idol groups and these feature a different take in terms of music and image that sets them apart. They may not necessarily be musical units, as is the case of radio units. They may not be officially addressed as such and are simply units in their own merit.

Examples: **Aqours** (Guilty Kiss, CYaRon!, AZALEA). **Idolish7** (MEZZO”, Pythagoras Trio, Fly away)
