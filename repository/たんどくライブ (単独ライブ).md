# 単独ライブ

**単独ライブ** – *tandoku-raibu*. **solo concert**, **solo live** or lit. **one-man live** (ワンマンライブ; *wanman-raibu*). Refers to concerts that feature only one main artist, which could be a person or group. This is considered a huge milestone for artists because it is much different from [festa-type events](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB%20=%20%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%20=%20%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%20=%20%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%82%B9) where the audience reaction is mixed and unpredictable, and they may have to win them over with sets that feature more popular songs. In solo concerts, the entire audience came for them, which gives them comfort to experiment with a conceptual setlist, various gimmicks, and MC segments. Fan reactions and calls are also more intense and unified, some even experimented there before spreading to general fandom. Within reason, special surprises can also be arranged between fans and/or staff, since they’re all there to have a memorable experience with the artist.
