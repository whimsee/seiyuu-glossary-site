# ボイスサンプル

**ボイスサンプル** - *boisu sampuru*. **Voice samples** are a set of pre-recorded samples based on a theme or specification (line reads, narration, free-talk, etc.). They are found on the agency’s website. They can be thought of as a *seiyuu*’s business card as it showcases what they can do without having to audition. In fact, this is what managers use to promote their talent during negotiations and sound directors may also screen through them before they call for auditions.
