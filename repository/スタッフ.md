# スタッフ

**スタッフ** – _sutaffu_. This refers to the **active support staff** or **production crew** who work behind the scenes at every production or event. It is a very broad term because it applies to anyone who isn’t the focus of attention, including key persons such as the director, makeup artist, stylist, photographer, even their manager, unless they are referred to specifically as such.
