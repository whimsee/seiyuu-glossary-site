# アンコール

**アンコール** – _ankōru_. **encore**. For concerts, this refers to additional performances done after the main show has ended. While these are technically extras (you are free to leave the venue at this point), they are actually planned as part of the show. These segments are more relaxed since the main show is over so the artists can wear whatever they want (usually event T-shirts) and perform however they wish. The song selections are also less constrained to the concept of the main set list so they may feature fan favorites, repeat performances, or new songs. Talk sessions may also happen here. Double encores also happen, as do triple encores.
