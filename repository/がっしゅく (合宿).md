# 合宿

**合宿** – _gasshuku_. **training camp** or **boot camp**. This applies more for groups where they spend a period of time together in one place, isolated from their usual environment, for the purposes of training and team building. These are tough experiences, with strict schedules and even stricter practice regimens, as they are done to encourage leaps of improvement in a short and concentrated period of time while also strengthening bonds between members due to the harsh environment.
