# 結婚

**結婚** – *kekkon*. **Marriage** in the *seiyuu* world isn’t as impactful (or even as punishing) as with other fields of entertainment. If anything, a revelation that a *seiyuu* is in a romantic relationship with someone is usually a hot topic that dies down quickly with little controversy, assuming there’s no **scandal** (スキャンダル; *sukyandaru*). That said, it is something people keep secret until they make that big announcement, usually in a form of a handwritten letter telling their fans that they’ve had their **name entered in the family register** (入家; *nyūka* | 籍に入れる; *seki ni ireru*). This does not necessarily mean a marriage ceremony happened or will happen, only that they have filed for marriage.

::: info
A lot of *seiyuu* marriages happened recently due to the period change from *Heisei* to *Reiwa*: to other *seiyuu*, to athletes, to fellow collaborators, to singers, or to people uninvolved with the industry (or what often gets directly translated into “an ordinary person”). Additionally, they are often announced around annual events like New Year's day.
