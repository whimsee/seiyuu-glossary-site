# CM

**CM** – Acronym for **Commercial Message**. Also referred to as **television advertisement** or **commercial**. These are the kinds of advertisements and announcements you see on TV or hear in radio shows for a commercial purpose. These are usually sponsored by a media company and broadcast through TV and radio, which sets it apart from PV as those can be produced and released independently through different channels (usually online).
