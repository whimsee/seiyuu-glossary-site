# 愛称

**愛称** – _aishō_. **Pet name** or **nickname** that gets assigned to them at the start of their career. Because Japanese names tend to overlap, this is one way to set them apart. A *seiyuu* may assign it to themselves, though more often than not, it gets decided by their fans and colleagues. The source of the name is essentially arbitrary, from puns of their names, to childhood nicknames, to a weird habit they do at work.

A *seiyuu* can have many nicknames, some even used in more personal settings than others. But once it sticks, it’s very unlikely for it to change so having a memorable one that is easy to say is important if not preferable.
