# 楽屋

**楽屋** – _gakuya_. **dressing room**. Private spaces where performers can take breaks, retouch, practice, chat, play games, etc. It is the setting of countless behind-the-scenes anecdotes that you’ll often hear in radio shows or read about in interviews. In a broader sense, it may also refer to the backstage as a whole.
