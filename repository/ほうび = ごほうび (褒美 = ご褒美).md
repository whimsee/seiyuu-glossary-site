# (ご)褒美

**(ご)褒美** – _(go)hōbi_. **Reward** or **prize**. This bears mentioning because you will often hear it from personalities during segments where they get a reward if they do well. They’ll always get the reward; even if they don’t satisfy the condition, the production crew will figure out some other, usually embarrassing, way for them to earn it. These prizes are prepared by them in advance and, while they do ask the personality what they like, it’s always a surprise as to what it actually is, which could range from gift cards to desserts.
