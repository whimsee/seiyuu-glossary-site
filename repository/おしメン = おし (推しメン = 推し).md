# 推しメン = 推し

**推しメン** | **推し** –  *oshimen* | *oshi*. This term can be translated in many different ways. Derived from *oshimen* (oshi-MEMBER), which applies to groups, it has since been adopted to solo personalities as well as it refers to who a fan considers their **favorite**. It is someone they have high hopes for and wishes to succeed in their endeavors. They might express that support in many ways: by attending events, rooting for them every chance they get, sending letters and presents, buying merchandise, growing a fanbase, etc. It doesn’t necessarily mean going crazy for them, but one probably can’t stay calm in front of their *oshi* either.

This also applies to **one’s favorite character** in an anime or game, referred to as **oshi-chara** (推しキャラ; *oshikyara*).
