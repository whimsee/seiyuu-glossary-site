# センター

**センター**– _sentā_. **_center_**. It is generally a female idol unit concept that refers to the focal member of a unit. This is not to be confused with the assigned **leader** (リーダー; _riidā_), though they may also be the center. This may also refer simply to the member located at the center of a formation, especially for odd-numbered units, or the main vocal of a song.

It is an important position as it typically carries the largest responsibility for the group’s image because they set the example and are often magnets of attention, which they may take advantage of to create an image or hype up the crowd. It also carries a strong reputation as the title itself can turn heads.
