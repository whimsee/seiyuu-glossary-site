# プロデューサー

**プロデューサー** – *purodyusā*. The **producer**, often referred to simply as **P**, handles the overall management and budgeting of a given work, project or product. They are responsible for gathering funds, hiring and managing staff, and networking with agencies, venues, and studios. They may even use their own money to fund a production, if necessary. They essentially handle the business side of production. 

Because of the amount of control they possess, they also participate in the production process itself. However, how involved they are and the skillsets expected of them depends on the medium as there are many different kinds of producers, while some producers used to be directors, musicians, creators, etc. as well.
