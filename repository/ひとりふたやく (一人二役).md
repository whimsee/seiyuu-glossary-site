# 一人二役

**一人二役** – _hitorifutayaku_. **double role.** Refers to a situation in dubbing, theater, reading dramas, where an actor is portraying two roles. Three or more may also occur (and appropriately called as such) especially in productions with small cast sizes. These situations tend to be a showcase of one’s acting and vocal range since the roles are usually divergent enough in age, background, personality, or gender that it requires an entirely different voice and approach.
