# フェードアウト

**フェードアウト –** _fēdo auto_. lit. fade out. It’s common slang that speaks for itself and in entertainment, it’s an ominous term that means **fade into obscurity**. A celebrity’s time under the spotlight is fleeting and even popular stars with long and successful careers can just fade from public consciousness with no explanation or send-off. Groups can cease activities and unceremoniously disband, leaving speculation and frustrated fans in their wake. Singing careers can go from having annual concerts to radio silence. A career hiatus is announced yet a comeback never happens.

It’s a common thing and the only ones who generally notice them are the fans because of its lack of explanation, if any comes out at all. There is always hope for a dramatic comeback which is possibly why it happens assuming it’s not a falling out, a scandal waiting to blow over, or just simple mismanagement.
