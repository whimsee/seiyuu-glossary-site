# 音響監督

**音響監督** – *onkyōkantoku*. **Director of audiography**, **audio director**, or **sound director**. The person in charge of audio production for animation and games, and Japanese dubbing of foreign works. In the *seiyuu* industry, this position holds a lot of weight because not only are they responsible for holding cast auditions (which are then decided in part by the director, sound director, author, producer, and many others), they also supervise and provide direction for *seiyuu* during the dubbing process. Having a good impression with a sound director goes a long way, probably more than most key staff positions.
