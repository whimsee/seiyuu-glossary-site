# ファンクラブ

**ファンクラブ** – _fan kurabu_. **Fan Club** or **FC**. Normally managed by their agency, these are special clubs that give *seiyuu*, idol units, and performing artists a way to deliver exclusive content to their fans that range from news, videos, images, community spaces, to advance tickets, or access to FC-only goods and events. They do require a subscription and a Japanese address. However, there is still hope for overseas fans since a lot of these subscriptions can be paid via foreign debit or credit card. Some even send out special birthday greetings on a fan’s birthday.
