# 退所

**退所** – *taisho*. Used when a *seiyuu* is **leaving their agency** either to look for other agencies or go freelance.

If they have left their agency but have not retired from the industry, they’re essentially considered **freelancers** (フリーランス; *furiiransu* or フリー; *furii*). This is a path usually taken by more popular *seiyuu* (**Yoshimasa Hosoya** and **Daisuke Ono** being two of the more popular freelance *seiyuu*) or those who are currently looking for another one.
