**ツアー** – *tsuā*. **tour**. A series of planned shows held in different venues to provide more people new opportunities to experience it. This is ideally for people in the area but hardcore fans and eventers benefit from it as well especially when schedules clash. For tours that go out to more remote places, it also gives the performer and their crew a chance to experience the area and its culture, and perhaps in some way, their fans as well who have decided to go there.

One thing worth noting is that tour shows aren’t always the same, which is one of its draws. Some tours go out of their way to make each show completely unique, with different setlists, segments, and surprises. They might even include aspects of the place it is hosted in, or draw inspiration from current events. They might do covers and special segments that won’t be included in the DVD/BD release.
