# 舞台挨拶

**舞台挨拶** – *butai aisatsu*. lit. **stage introduction**. These are press activities done as part of some **preview or advance screenings** (試写会; *shisha-kai*), usually premier ones, where actors who star in the film as well as production staff such as the director will come on stage to address the audience. This is usually done before the movie starts to introduce the movie then once again after it finishes to relay their thoughts and insight about it, as well as thank the audience for joining them; in some cases where performing groups are involved, they may even do a mini-concert. Such activities are usually reported in press outlets.  
  
Since this is not done for all screenings, and because this is an opportunity to meet actors and staff, they are advertised as such with  **舞台挨拶予定** (*butai aitsu yotei*) or **舞台挨拶あり** (*butai aisatsu ari*).  And unlike regular preview screenings that may raffle out tickets so people can watch it for free, tickets for these events must be purchased in advance.  
  
There is another version of this where they do a short talk segment instead. Such events are marked **トークショー付き** (*tōku shō-tsuki*; lit. talk show included)
