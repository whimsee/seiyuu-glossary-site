# チェキ会

**チェキ会** – _cheki-kai_. **cheki event** or **photo opportunity**. You get to take an instant camera picture with the celebrity. It is recommended to check the guidelines beforehand for these events because they may vary. Generally, poses will be announced or decided upon immediately prior to the event itself. You will pick one as you surrender the ticket to the staff. You can’t bring gifts (there are present boxes provided at every event) but you may bring props at the discretion of the organizer. Interactions can last until the cheki develops and you have the chance to check and reshoot but you must decide that as soon as you receive the picture.

You may also encounter terms such as as **two-shot cheki** (2ショットチェキ or ツーショットチェキ; _tsū shotto cheki_) which means a cheki with two people in it. It does NOT mean you will get two separate photos. Variations of that term also exist.
