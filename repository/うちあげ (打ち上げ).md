# 打ち上げ

**打ち上げ** – _uchiage_. **afterparty**, **wrap party**, or **launch party**. It is a general term used to describe get-togethers between collaborators after an event has wrapped up or work has been completed. In *seiyuu* jargon, it can also refer to launch parties for anime releases (broadcast or BD) where everyone involved with the project is invited so they can network, mingle, and catch up.
