# 作品

**作品**  – _sakuhin_. A catch-all term that means **work, project, production**, or **performance**.  Heavily context-dependent as it can refer to a series, a franchise, a specific work, adaptation, or a finished product as a whole. You’ll encounter this word often so you’ll get used to identifying what it is they’re referring to.
