# 卒業

**卒業** – *sotsugyō*. Literally means graduate but it’s more an euphemism for **leaving a group**, **quitting a project**, or **doing something for the last time**, often with a sense of finality as if there’s no going back (at least in the near future). It’s an amicable expression because these “graduations” are celebrated with a send-off and a good word from both parties, though you might also just see this used colloquially to mean that they’re “finally done doing that thing” without much sentimentality or to soften the blow.
