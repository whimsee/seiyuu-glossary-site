# 録音放送

**録音放送** – _rokuon-hōsō_. Shows may be broadcast as **pre-recorded** because of scheduling constraints, to fit a timeslot that would be impractical for a live format (such as late night broadcasts), or to satisfy a set monthly schedule (as is the case for channels with multiple shows). While they are usually recorded two or more episodes at a time, some shows do record only one at a time; those shows normally ask for fan mail days, even hours, beforehand.

The difference between live and pre-recorded programs lie in the interactions. There are no comments to react to so it’s mostly up to the scriptwriter to act as the personality’s sounding board and you’ll often hear them in the background as a result. If there is a guest or co-host, the relationship between them tends to become more apparent or exaggerated, especially for radio shows, giving them that supposedly distinct “radio show” feel.

For some *seiyuu*, this is a tough format because they enjoy directly interacting with live comments, relying on that to make decisions that carry them through the show. Some thrive in this solo, isolated environment because they can just talk however they wish and the production crew will guide them along if they’re going off-topic or if they begin to ramble because it will be edited in post-production.
