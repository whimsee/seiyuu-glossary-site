# 振り付け

**振り付け** – *furitsuke*. Generally refers to **dance choreography** though sometimes it becomes synonymous with **dance** (ダンス; *dansu*). According to some *seiyuu*, this is increasingly becoming a skill that a *seiyuu* is expected to know and understand, especially with the rise of idol culture. That said, choreography doesn’t necessarily mean intense dancing as it only refers to a sequence of body movements and position changes (formation changes as well if it’s a group); an artist may only stay on one spot the whole time, moving only their arm, and it is still choreography. 

For solo acts, artists may design the choreography themselves or play it by ear. For groups, keeping up with choreography is an essential skill. They are assigned a main **choreographer** (振付師; *furitsukeshi* | 振り付け先生; *furitsuke-sensei*) who devises entire sequences for each song, as well as give them pointers and advice after each performance. Since choreography is one of an artist or group’s main selling points, it’s an intrinsic part of their identity so it’s common to see aspects of their movements becoming part of call-and-response routines.
