# ナレーション

**ナレーション** – *narēshon*. **Narration** is commentary used to accompany a story, movie, commercial, etc. It is one of the fundamental skills a *seiyuu* learns as they are delivered differently in terms of expression and intonation. As such, some schools specialize in developing this specific skill and some *seiyuu* are identified as narrators.
