# 千秋楽

**千秋楽**  – *senshūraku*. Refers to the **last day of a stage show’s run**, which would mean stage plays, concerts, reading dramas, etc. You’ll often hear this mentioned throughout the show’s run by performers and supporters, wishing for good health and great performances until they wrap up the **final show** (**大千秋楽** ; *daisenshūraku*)
