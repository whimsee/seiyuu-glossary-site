# プレゼントボックス

**プレゼントボックス** – *purezento bokkusu*. **present box** or **gift box**. These are containers found at lobbies during events, usually marked by name, where you can leave presents for the performers. The presents could be anything within reason as long as they’re not raw or food that perishes quickly. If you sent a present as part of a letter, make sure to mention and describe it in the letter so the addressee would know since those items tend to be screened separately. If the box is not named, make sure to put the name of the performer on the present (post-its are provided). If there is no box, try approaching the staff and they will handle it from there. 

*Seiyuu* generally don’t live in large spaces, especially if they moved to Tokyo, so what usually happens when there’s too much stuff to keep is they would have them delivered to their parental home where it is essentially kept in storage. Of course, food gets eaten or shared and you’ll hear about it sometimes as talking points.
