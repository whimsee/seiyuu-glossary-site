# タオル

**タオル** – *taoru*. **Towels** are staple event goods that feature designs exclusive to the event. You often see this displayed in pictures or spun around during special moments in concerts. They come in different varieties although this only applies if they are selling more than one: **Muffler** or **scarf towels** (マフラータオル; *mafurā taoru*) that are easy to carry and wear, and the wider **big towel** (ビッグタオル; *biggu taoru*).
