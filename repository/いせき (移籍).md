# 移籍

**移籍** – _iseki_. **transfer**. A term used when someone is officially transferring from one agency or label to another. This could be because they’re unhappy with their management, they’re looking for other opportunities, the agency is restructuring, or they’ve decided to let them go. Or it could be simply that their contract has ended.
