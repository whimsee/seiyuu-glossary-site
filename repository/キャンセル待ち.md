# キャンセル待ち

**キャンセル待ち**– *kyanseru-machi*. It is an airport and lodging vernacular that refers to a **waiting list** where you wait for someone to cancel their ticket.

For events, it’s less of a list and more of a line or a crowd waiting for same-day tickets to be released or for more seats to be accomodated, which are usually raffled out if too many people show up. You get a number and shortly before the show starts (5 – 30 minutes), they will call out numbers or display them on a bulletin board. If you hit, head to the counter where you pay for the ticket, usually in cash.
