**通販** – _tsūhan_. **mail order** or **online shopping**. Goods can be purchased remotely or online nowadays which is convenient since they can be shipped to your door, or bought via proxy if you’re from overseas.

An important thing worth noting, however, is that this applies more to official sellers than resellers because the former has a catalog you can choose from, the latter does not. Payment methods vary depending on the seller as most don’t accept foreign credit cards and small scale releases may only accept bank payments. This is where having access to a good proxy service comes in handy. However, note that some proxy services also don’t do bank payments due to the possibility of scams.
