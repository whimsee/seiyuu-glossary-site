# アドリブ

**アドリブ** – *adoribu*. **ad-lib**. Refers to anything done off-script or without complete oversight and preparation from the production staff, whether it’s a spoken line, a gag on stage, or a goofy moment on a program. It happens more often than you think since everything runs off a script, even for a program, but depending on the writer or director, they allow spaces where the *seiyuu* can exercise more creative freedom (or they trust them enough to do it).

Ad-lib sections for voiced lines are fun because most of the time, a *seiyuu* is only provided cues or prompts without any specific directions. They can go ham, often leading to hilarious and memorable results. Comedic works are full of ad-lib, which could go anywhere.
