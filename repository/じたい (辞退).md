# 辞退

**辞退**– *jitai*. When a *seiyuu* **pulls out of an event or a role**, it’s usually due to **illness or poor physical condition** (体調不良 ; *taichōfuryō*), a scheduling error, or a visa issue for overseas events. In cases of illness, the PR move is to be silent on social media until after the event they were supposed to go to is over, even longer if it’s a serious medical issue. They may also address it directly before going silent, urging that no more inquiries are made until further notice. The point is to not make people worry and speculate so usually the cause of illness is disclosed if it’s a common case and recovery is expected.
