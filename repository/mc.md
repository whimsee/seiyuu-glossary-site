# MC

**MC** – While it is an acronym for “Master of Ceremonies”, it has taken a different meaning for events as it refers to **talk segments** and **talk portions** where performers can take a break and directly address the audience. These segments can be notoriously long, depending on the artist or group — some take 5 minutes, some 40 minutes especially for final MCs. What they say also depends — some have spiels that they follow, others wing it completely as time allows which can lead to fun moments especially in large casts and with more charismatic artists.

For some *seiyuu*, this is a skill they learn to develop and is probably one of the harder things they get to do because not every *seiyuu* expects to be on stage, nor do they prefer doing so without a plan. So some are great at it, some are not. For group events, one is tasked to be the main MC that carries the show along and hypes up the crowd.
