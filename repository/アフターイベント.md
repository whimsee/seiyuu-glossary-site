# アフターイベント

**アフターイベント** – _afutā ibento_. Lit. after-event. They refer to **follow-up events** held after the principal event is over. These may come in the form of fan meets, or the case of theater and reading dramas, smaller productions that feature side stories or after-stories that build from the main story.
