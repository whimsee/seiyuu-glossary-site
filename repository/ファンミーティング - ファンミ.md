# ファンミーティング - ファンミ

**ファンミーティング** | **ファンミ** – *fan miitingu* | *fan'mi*. lit. **fan meeting,** **fan meet**, or **fan event**. These special events are hard to describe because they’re unique aside from the fact that it gathers fans to one place for them to know the person or group better. They might involve talk sessions, live performances, skits and gags, food and drink spaces, personal revelations, game contests, cheki events, or even a combination of them. If you’re a hardcore fan, these are events worth going to because the types of interactions here are relatively more intimate and lenient than most and they are rarely recorded to be released in DVD/BD form. However, they are also difficult to get into because it may require a fan club subscription, winning a ticket lottery, or both.
