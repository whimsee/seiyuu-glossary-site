# カメラマン

**カメラマン** – *kameraman*. **photographer** or **videographer**, whichever is applicable. They handle and operate the camera for shoots in movies, TV, magazines, newspapers, etc. 

Literally speaking, **cameraman** is valid, however there is a nuance that it refers to a male especially in Japanese (*man* is in the word). To be more precise or if the photographer/videographer is female,  **フォトグラファー** (*fotogurafā*) or **ビデオグラファー** (*bideogurafā*) is used instead.
