# 生放送

**生放送** – *namahōsō*. **Live broadcast** of a program.  As it is aired live, there is no room for edits and all adjustments are done on the fly. It tests the *seiyuu*’s ability to stick to a script, manage time, and think on their feet if needed. For the viewer, however, it comes with the perk of seeing reactions as **comments** (コメント; *komento*) in real-time and interacting with them is part of the fun, hence why some prefer doing this over pre-recording.

Due to its roots as a TV broadcasting term, *namahōsō* is a specific term used for programs and radio shows since they are more structured than most live streaming content, and it also sounds more official. See [*namahaishin*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%AA%E3%81%BE%E3%81%AF%E3%81%84%E3%81%97%E3%82%93%20%28%E7%94%9F%E9%85%8D%E4%BF%A1%28) for livestreamed content.
