# BD

**BD** – **Blu-ray Disc** or simply **Blu-ray**. This high-capacity format is used for video releases with a standard resolution of 1920×1080 (it can go as high as 4K but I haven't seen that for *seiyuu* content). You mostly see this used for live recordings produced by larger media entities and you get the best quality possible, along with possible extras. As such, they generally cost more.

However, some of them come with perks for early purchasers such as advance sale/lotteries for tickets. For multi-day events, the final show tends to be the one released for the Blu-ray since the curtain call or final remarks are also included. On two-show days, the evening session is usually included in an anime’s DVD release or sometimes it merits its own video release — *Free* and *Yuri On Ice* *seiyuu* events being examples.

Worth noting is that people may still refer to BDs as DVDs even if they only exist in BD format.
