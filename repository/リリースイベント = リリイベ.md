# リリースイベント = リリイベ

**リリースイベント** | **リリイベ** – *ririisu ibento* | *riri’ibe*. **Release events** are a series of events held to promote a product around the time of release. It’s a broad description because other types of events are built off of it such as meet-and-greets, cheki events, handshake events, signing events, mini-concerts, fan meets, etc. While interaction is allowed for some of these events, rules will state about permission to be nudged or pushed by staff in order to keep the line moving.

You generally need to purchase the item in order to fully participate. Organizers issue different guidelines if you want to avail for these perks and events.
