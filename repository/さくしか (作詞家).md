# 作詞家

**作詞家** – *sakushika*. For song recordings, the **lyricist** is the writer. It varies if they directly aid the composer in making the song since some lyrics are written after the music has been composed, while some compositions are done in tandem with or based on the lyrics. They are not usually present during the recording itself but it does happen, which allows the singer with the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the song. Otherwise, the composer would be the one providing the insight. While there are professional lyricists and singer-songwriters, it is not uncommon for *seiyuu* to write the lyrics of their songs.
