# ポリープ

**ポリープ** – *poriipu*. **polyp**. For this glossary, this specifically refers to vocal cord polyps. These are reddish growths that occur on one or both vocal cords. Since voice acting makes heavy use of the vocal cords (especially if singing is involved), overuse or misuse (among many other reasons) can lead to them occurring. It results in vocal fatigue, pain, coughing, loss of vocal range, or having a voice that is scratchy or raspy.  
  
Even with careful use, there’s always a risk so it’s not uncommon for news to come out about *seiyuu* and artists taking short breaks to treat them. Such cases tend to involve surgery, which come with their own risks since every case is unique, and a recuperation period of one month where they won’t be able to work or do events.
