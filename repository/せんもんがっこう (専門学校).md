# 専門学校

**専門学校** – _senmon-gakkō_. **specialized training college**, **voice acting academy**, or **seiyuu school**. There are many more ways to translate this. Narration schools and acting schools that have voice acting courses also classify under this. This is a common path pursued by *seiyuu* hopefuls. Generally, the way to enter one is via entrance exam and/or interview that they can take anytime after graduating high school regardless of age, making it a preferable choice for those who don’t intend to pursue further studies through college, as well as those who are considering a career change.

Students are expected to stick to a strict schedule doing **lessons** (レッスン; *resson*) and they are taught all the fundamentals — from learning how to express emotions, improvisation, to observing proper business etiquette — over the course of two years. Students are exposed to the several types of jobs a *seiyuu* is expected to do. These institutions also provide support in terms of housing, opportunities for auditions, and many other ways to break into the industry. Guest lecturers are invited from different talent agencies, often alumni. Graduates who do well have a possibility of getting scouted.
