# 仮歌

**仮歌** – _kariuta_. A **demo track** or **demo** is a tentative version of the song made so that the singer can practice the song and get a feel for the melody (which is also subject to change). They usually incorporate beats to guide the singer along. Guide vocals are also included and these are usually sung by the lyricist/songwriter or by another singer. For solo and idol music, this tends to be the norm. For bands, their vocalist may record the demo vocals instead. For singer-songwriters, they may do that themselves.
