# カップリング曲

**カップリング曲** – _kappuringu-kyoku_. The **coupling track** or the **B-Side** (B面; _bi-men_) of a music single. Commonly referred to as the lesser known extra track/s of a single release and they tend to be more unconventional and personal in its composition or delivery. You don’t usually hear this track unless you bought the single but there have been cases in anime where it gets played as an insert song or a one-off theme of a special episode.
