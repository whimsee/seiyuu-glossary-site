# 特典

**特典** – *tokuten*. **Special freebies** or **bonus goods** that may come with purchased items and event tickets. These could range from trading cards and clear files to more substantial content such as soundtracks and pamphlets. They tend to become collectors items because of their limited quantity and rarity. It’s not uncommon for someone to buy multiple copies of the same item to get the *tokuten* they want, either because they are random draws or store-specific. Some *tokuten* come bundled with the item, some have to be redeemed at the cashier or a booth that distributes them.
