# TO

**TO** – **Top Otaku**. Term used within fandom circles to mean someone who quite literally goes the extra mile for their *oshi*. They go to every event no matter how far, never misses a chance to send fan mail, always willing to find ways to make their *oshi* smile. It is a point of pride for some otaku. In some way, they tend to know more than most and become useful sources of information, advice, and connections.
