# ネタバレ

**ネタバレ** – *netabare*. **spoilers**. It is a combination of two words, *neta* (ねた; information) + bareru (ばれる; to expose). It works the same way in English as it refers to any kind of information leak but it is commonly used for important story spoilers in entertainment media like anime, games, TV, movies, and theater. As one would expect, spoiling one’s own work is not a good idea but once the moment has passed, they are free to talk about it in social media and in shows.
