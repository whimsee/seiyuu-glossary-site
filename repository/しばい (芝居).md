# 芝居

**芝居** – *shibai*. Refers to **acting** as art as opposed to [*engi*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%88%E3%82%93%E3%81%8E%20%28%E6%BC%94%E6%8A%80%29) which is more about the performance. You see this more often used in stage productions but you’ll also see this in voice acting when *seiyuu* talk about wanting to get better at acting as a whole or when comparing themselves to others as an actor.
