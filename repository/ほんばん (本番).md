# 本番

**本番** – *honban*. Refers to the **actual show** that you came to watch and participate in as there are many parts in a program that happen before and after it. This is then broken into parts such as [*zenhan*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%9C%E3%82%93%E3%81%AF%E3%82%93%20%28%E5%89%8D%E5%8D%8A%29) and [*kouhan*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%93%E3%81%86%E3%81%AF%E3%82%93%20%28%E5%BE%8C%E5%8D%8A%29). [*Omake*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%8A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%91) are usually not counted but there are exceptions. 

This also applies to entertainment in general so you may hear it in the context of events where it refers to the main show, differentiating it from other elements such as the opening of doors to let the audience in, public rehearsals, test runs, etc.
