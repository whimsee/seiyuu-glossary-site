# DD

**DD** – Acronym for **_Daredemo Daisuki_** (誰でも大好き), which is a term used to describe someone who is an avid supporter of idols in every sense of the word and they are willing to go above and beyond to show that support. That said, the term is starting to be used for just about every kind of fandom outside idols.
