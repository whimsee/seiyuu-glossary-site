# 朗読劇 - 朗読会

**朗読劇** | **朗読会** – *rōdokugeki* | *rōdoku-kai*. **Reading drama** or **public reading**. A dramatic reading done in front of an audience. This can be considered a theatrical production as it involves elements such as costumes, lighting, music, sound effects, blocking, and set design.

Having attended a few of these, it’s like watching a live *afureko* with some neat production effects. Mic stands are placed on stage with seats behind them for the actor to rest as others take focus. They wear outfits that suit the setting, read from a script (much like the ones you can buy as merchandise) as they act out lines through voice and minimal actions. They may rotate from one mic to another to signify a change in time, setting, or character since actors may voice multiple roles. Shows generally last an hour and a half with no breaks, and there may be an after-talk segment at the end. It’s a form of stage production and personally, it’s one of the best ways to experience a *seiyuu* in their element as they react to each other and the audience, and you pick up on their mannerisms that don’t come across anywhere else.
