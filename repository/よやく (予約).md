# 予約

**予約** – *yoyaku*. **advance order** or **preorder**. Virtually every product lately has a preorder period where you can purchase the item in advance so the store can reserve a copy for you that can be picked up in-store or shipped. That’s one advantage of preordering but the real hook are the extras that may come with some of these offerings which may be store-specific and limited while supplies last.
