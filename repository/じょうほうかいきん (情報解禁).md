# 情報解禁

**情報解禁** – *jōhō-kaikin*. Useful kanji to note because it means **information has been released/revealed to the public** or **allowed to be released to the public**. Nothing special about it per se but you might see this instead of words that mean **notice** or **announcement** such as *oshirase* (お知らせ), *happyou* (発表), *kokuchi* (告知). In fact, you may omit the literal meaning of the word and convey the message as such.
