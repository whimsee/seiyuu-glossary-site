# 前半

**前半** – *zenhan*. The **former half** of a program (see [bangumi](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%B0%E3%82%93%E3%81%90%E3%81%BF%20%28%E7%95%AA%E7%B5%84%29)). This is where introductions take place and some catching up with the host’s (and the guest and assistant, if present) activities since they last appeared before ending with announcements and reminders of their future activities. Fan mail might get read and some sponsored segments will be done here but most of them are usually reserved for the latter half. For shows with a subscription, this is usually the free portion. It’s important to note that a program’s distinctive segments and gimmicks might not show up here.
