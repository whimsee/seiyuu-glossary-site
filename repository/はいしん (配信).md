# 配信

**配信** – *haishin*. You see this in announcements where a product (anime, song, etc.) is available for **digital or online distribution** or a program is available to be **streamed online**. This is not generally used for TV broadcasts where the term used is *hōsō*. 

Because these kinds of content are digitally distributed, they are subject to issues involving ownership, piracy, preservation, subscription, and access from overseas.
