# 決定

**決定** – _kettei_. There’s no proper word to translate this into only that it conveys that something has been **decided upon** and is officially being carried out. They’re usually found in announcements in place of words that mean that something has been announced. In fact, in those cases you may omit the word itself and communicate the message in that manner.
