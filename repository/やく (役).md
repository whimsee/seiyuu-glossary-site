# 役

**役** – *yaku*. **role**. You often hear a *seiyuu* say, “*[Character name] yaku no [Seiyuu name] desu*” when introducing themselves. It is the character they’ve been assigned to portray in a given work. It’s a general term that is used not just in voice work but in other forms of media such as theater and drama recordings, which is important to note because a character in a drama CD might not be voiced by the same seiyuu in the anime version.
