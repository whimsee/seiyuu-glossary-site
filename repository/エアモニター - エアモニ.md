# エアモニター - エアモニ

**エアモニター** | **エアモニ** – *eamonitā* | *eamoni*. **IEM (In-Ear Monitor)**. Refers to the earbuds that performers wear to accurately hear what’s being picked up by the mics and instrumentals during a performance as well as receive instructions or cues given to them by staff. They come in two parts: Custom-fit earbuds that block out ambient noise, and a wireless transmitter-receiver pack that is worn by the performer.

They are very effective tools that allow the wearer to focus on their performance and in some cases, such as performing on carts and remote places in a concert venue, that’s the only way they can keep track of the music. However, it does come with a key drawback of being too good at filtering out noise as it also keeps out crowd noise, which is part of the atmosphere of a live performance. Some performers actually remark positively on instances when they do hear the noise, or they simply take one or both out when they’re comfortable so they can hear and respond to them.
