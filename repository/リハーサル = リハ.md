# リハーサル = リハ

**リハーサル** | **リハ** – *rihāsaru* | *riha*. **Rehearsal**, **practice**, or **training**. This is more often used for concerts and physically-involved productions. For acting-focused productions such as theatre and reading dramas, you may encounter the more formal term **keiko** (稽古); it essentially means the same and is interchangeable to an extent.

Practice sessions for acting events usually start a month before the actual show. The cast will meet regularly (ideally, as schedule allows) and rehearse together, talk about their interpretation of the story and characters, and establish rapport so they can perform comfortably with a clear idea for the actual show. Generally, there will be a rehearsal before each performance on the day of the show. Concert rehearsals generally start sooner so that performers can condition their bodies and build their stamina, especially if they haven’t done a show in a while. This also gives more leeway for changes in the program, setlist, choreography, etc.
