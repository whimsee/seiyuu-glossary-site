# 罰ゲーム (ばつゲーム)

**罰ゲーム (ばつゲーム)** – _batsu gēmu_. This can be translated in many ways — **penalty**, **dare**, **challenge**, or **punishment** — as it doesn’t actually refer to a game in the competitive sense. Rather, it refers to something the loser has to do as stipulated because they lost a contest or failed a solo challenge (in those cases, they do it to get the reward).  
  
It is usually something embarrassing that they wouldn’t want to do if they could help it such as saying cute things on camera, smiling for a certain amount of time, dancing, acting out a scenario, etc. As such, it serves as a good incentive to win because it could be anything and the winner (or staff for solo challenges) decides what they would do. It is generally harmless since it is all in good fun for the audience but it can be a source of hilarious moments that might haunt the loser for years to come.
