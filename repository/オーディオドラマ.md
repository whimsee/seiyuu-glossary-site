# オーディオドラマ

**オーディオドラマ** – *ōdio dorama*. **audio drama**. Traditionally, this was the kind of work expected of voice actors during the heyday of **radio dramas** (ラジオドラマ; *rajio dorama*) where you only hear the voice of the actor and nothing else. Nowadays, you still encounter this format along with many other recordings of literary works such as **rōdoku CDs** (朗読CD), and **audiobooks** (オーディオブック; *ōdio bukku*). Drama CDs are also gaining more traction as they tend to be supplemental material for anime, games, and manga. They all come in physical and/or digital formats.
