# DVD

**DVD** – **Digital Versatile Disc** or simply **DVD**. This disk format is used for video releases with a standard resolution of 720×480 pixels. It’s still being used heavily for recordings of smaller stage productions because the theatre company can manufacture the CD themselves per order and variety shows even with the existence of Blu-ray. However, those DVD releases can cost as much as a regular Blu-ray release.

Radio CDs may also be released on DVD with the contents included as .mp3 audio files that you can freely copy.
