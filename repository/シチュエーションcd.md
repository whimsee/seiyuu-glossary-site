# シチュエーションCD

**シチュエーションCD** - *shichuēshon CD*. lit. **situation CD** or **scenario CD**. They are audio dramas that feature scenarios one could immerse themselves in such as “Man in the middle of an intense quarrel (with you)” or “Forbidden love between a princess (you) and a knight.” They are best experienced with headphones.  
  
Like BLCDs, they are popular with female audiences but unlike BLCDs, the content is more general (even mundane) and the actor’s real names are revealed as they tend to be part of the appeal, if not the draw, of the material.
