# パンフレット

**パンフレット** – *panfuretto*. **Pamphlet**, **brochure**, **booklet**, **playbill**, or **programme**. It’s a broad term so the exact translation varies but “pamphlet” is more commonly used even though it usually comes in the form of a booklet. It contains information about the event, words from the cast and/or staff, interviews, lyrics, behind-the-scenes pictures, credits, etc. This is uncommon but some pamphlets may also come with *tokuten* CD/DVDs.
