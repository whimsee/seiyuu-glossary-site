# コール

**コール** – *kōru*. **call**. For concerts, this refers to a broad category of cheers and **call-and-response routines** (コールアンドレスポンス; *kōru ando resuponsu*) done during key moments in performances. These actions tend to be synchronized with set cheers and gestures, and they may occur spontaneously and/or designed by the artist and/or fans.

There is an offshoot specific to idol culture called **wotagei** (ヲタ芸) with its own set of cheers and gestures involving glow sticks. Its specifics won’t be covered here but I’ll just note that there is more to this rabbit hole.
