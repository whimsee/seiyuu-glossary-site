# タイアップ

**タイアップ** – *taiappu*. **tie up**. These are direct business collaborations done between different industries (for example, anime and music) in order to boost the brands they carry and, in most cases, even get projects off the ground by way of sponsor agreements. It comes in many forms but in music, doing a tie up is one way for record labels to push artists into mainstream attention, or for an anime franchise to gain attention through a popular artist. Or both, especially for high-budget franchises.

Tie ups are interesting to follow because this is where you may see how sponsor influence can determine *seiyuu* castings. For example, a record label doing the music or the theme song for an anime can recommend *seiyuu* under them to be part of the cast. It’s almost a guarantee that they’ll get supporting roles but a main role isn’t out of the question. That said, just because a *seiyuu* or a group did the theme song doesn’t mean it was a sponsored tie up as there have been cases where they were directly given the offer by the production staff themselves.
