# 感想

**感想** – _kansō_. **impression**, **opinion**, or **feedback**. This is a general term that you will encounter often since personalities and staff always encourage their audience to send feedback about their work. It could be about the program itself, their performance, an event, etc. Much like fan mail and comments, this matters a lot because some decisions are taken into consideration based on feedback from social media, emails, and **survey forms** (アンケート; _ankēto_) especially for smaller productions.
