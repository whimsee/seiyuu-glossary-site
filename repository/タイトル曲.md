# タイトル曲

**タイトル曲** – *taitoru-kyoku*. The **title track** or **A-Side** (A面; *ē-men*) of a music single. Commonly referred to as the main song of a single release. If it is a song featured in an anime, this is the one you will most often hear because they are likely to be a full version of an opening or ending theme.
