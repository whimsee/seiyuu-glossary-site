# 演出

**演出** – _enshutsu_. **production**. Including this because you can easily confuse one with the other. Refers to the hard work that happens behind the scenes. Direction, set design, scriptwriting, scheduling, casting, etc. This is also not mutually exclusive as some multi-talented *seiyuu* actually do double duty and take on production roles while also being part of the show proper.
