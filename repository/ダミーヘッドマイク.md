**ダミーヘッドマイク** – lit. **dummy head mic**. **Dummy head recording** is a stereo recording system that involves two microphones that correspond to the left and right ear in order to simulate a 3D audio environment. The “dummy” part comes from the Moai-like head that houses the mics, which are very sensitive in that they require headphones for the best experience. A *seiyuu* records through these for Boys’ Love (BL) or *yaoi* works, though they are also utilized for ASMR and as gimmicks in some programs.
