# アフタトーク

**アフタトーク** – *afuta-tōku*. Lit. After-talk. These are **post-show talk sessions** that take place after the main show is over, including the curtain call if there is one. They are usually done in theater and reading dramas and they generally last 10-15 minutes where select members of the cast communicate their thoughts about the performance and answer questions from the audience (sent beforehand via form). Birthday celebrations may also be done here.
