# 冠番組

**冠番組** – _kanmuri-bangumi_. Refers to the concept of **programs named after their main personalities and sponsors**, specifically the advertising sponsor that funds the show.  
  
Since the program’s title is typically the most visible thing (if not the first thing) one encounters, the title is a powerful advertising tool in and of itself. As such, it has become standard practice for some sponsors to attach to the title their name or a brand they’re pushing, along with the names of the main personalities—individually or as a group. The name may be presented as is or as a variation (nickname, shortened name, or pun) that is still recognizable. Worth noting, however, is that not all programs are sponsored even if they’re being hosted on a media platform, and not all programs named after their sponsor include the names of their main personalities (and vice versa).
