# コスチュームチェンジ

**コスチュームチェンジ** – *kosuchūmu chenji*. **costume change** or **outfit change**. These are one of many types of intermission segments during shows where the performers leave the stage to rest, retouch, freshen up, and change outfits as the stage gets set-up for the next sequence. A lengthy video or a live musical intermission may also play on the main stage to maintain the energy of the crowd and prepare them for what comes next.
