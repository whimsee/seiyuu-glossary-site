# ふつおた

**ふつおた** - *futsuota*. Short for 普通のお便り (*futsū no otayori*). A term that originated in radio programs, it refers to **fan mail that aren’t written for a program’s unique segment/s** since they request for mail pertaining to set themes as a way to facilitate interaction (ie. about cooking, embarrassing moments, etc.).  
  
Essentially, this kind of fan mail can be about anything but they usually fall along the lines of a.) messages of support. b.) questions about certain topics. c.) requests for advice d.) quirky and funny anecdotes in everyday life. They usually get read during the start of the show to kick things off and/or at the end to wind things down. In that sense, they are considered as their own segment (informally if not officially) where the personality can converse freely with their audience.
