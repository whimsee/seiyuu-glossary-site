# プロモーター

**プロモーター** – *puromōtā*. The **promoter** is a straightforward role with different activities based on who they work for and what they are promoting.

For programs, they schedule when the show airs. They are rarely on set since they are busy advertising the show and whatever else they are responsible for because they are usually tied directly to the station.

For music labels, they are responsible for doing face-to-face promotional interactions with production staff in media outlets such as radio stations. For example, when a new song gets featured in a radio show, this is because a promoter went to the director of the show with a CD copy of the song and asked if they could feature it. That way, the staff doesn’t have to buy it, they can feature it if they happen to like it, and it establishes rapport which may open more promotion opportunities.

This methodology basically applies to any medium and industry though it is worth noting that social media activities generally don’t fall under their duties (at least from the sources I’ve read), hence the emphasis on physical interaction.
