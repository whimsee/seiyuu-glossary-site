# ワード数

**ワード数** – *wā-do kazu*. **line count**. It refers to the number of lines (台詞 or セリフ; *serifu*) a *seiyuu* would have to voice in given script, which are then part of how a seiyuu’s pay is calculated, especially for games and narrations (see [*gyara*](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC)). This is counted regardless of actual length which means short utterances such as はい! (*hai!*) hold as much weight as long monologues.
