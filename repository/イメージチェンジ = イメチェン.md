# イメージチェンジ = イメチェン

**イメージチェンジ** | **イメチェン** – *imēji chenji* | *imechen*. Lit. image change. **Makeover**. Part of being in the entertainment industry is maintaining a distinct image. Any significant change, which could be as little as changing hair color to something big like projecting a completely different vibe, is considered as such.
