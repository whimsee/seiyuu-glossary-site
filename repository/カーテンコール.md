# カーテンコール

**カーテンコール** – _kāten kōru_. **curtain call**. Takes place after a performance where the entire cast enters the stage one last time to address the audience and do the final bow. 

In theatre, this only happens in the final show and it lasts quite a while since it is the only time the cast gets to open up one-by-one (usually breaking down in tears) about what they felt about the entire experience. As such, this usually gets included in the DVD/BD release along with the show.

For concerts, this segment is usually called the final MC though curtain call may also be used.
