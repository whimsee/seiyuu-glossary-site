# 展示

**展示** – *tenji*. **exhibit** or **display**. This is a common feature in specialty stores where a spot is set up for a group, an artist, or an anime that is filled with every kind of related media they sell — from CDs, DVDs, blu-rays, photo books, magazines they feature in, resale items, etc. These are normally done at the discretion of the store or as a promotional move coinciding with a release. The size of the exhibits can range from a simple shelf display to an entire floor. Special kinds of exhibits may also be arranged such as an **outfit exhibit** (衣装展; *ishō-ten*).
