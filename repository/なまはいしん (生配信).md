# 生配信

**生配信** – *namahaishin*. **Live streaming** over the internet. It may be used interchangeably with *namahōsō* due to both of them being live broadcasts. It is a broader term, however, since it covers not just programs but anything that is streamed in real-time on the internet such as gaming streams, festival showcases, concert live streams, tournament streams, etc.

To put into similar context, all content you see streamed live on Twitch, YouTube, Nico Nico, and countless other live streaming services are *namahaishin*. Once the content is not streaming live but are instead viewable as VODs (Video on Demand) or archive streams, they are simply called **videos** (動画; *dōga*) or **archives** (アーカイブ; *ākaibu*).
