# 後半

**後半** – _kōhan_. The **latter half** of a program (see [bangumi](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%B0%E3%82%93%E3%81%90%E3%81%BF%20%28%E7%95%AA%E7%B5%84%29)). Often done with paid shows as its “members-only” content. This portion is more flexible since this is focused on personal interaction with the viewers. Personalities read fan mail, answer questions, or do cute, cool, and silly stuff during their segments. While technically different from extras (see [omake](https://seiyuu.yakuaru.com/%E3%81%8A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%91)), some programs consider the latter half as such by calling them **omake-hōsō** (おまけ放送).
