# 作家

**作家** – _sakka_. **writer.** For anime and dubbing, the **script writer** writes the **script** (脚本; _kyakuhon_) that is read by the actors. It is worth noting that a different type of script is produced for dubbing which is then edited and polished further by the actors. The script writer can be the author of the original work and in those cases, they tend to be present in the studio to provide feedback, assistance, and direction.

For programs, the script writer writes the script and program guidelines that the personality follows or falls back on if they get stuck. They also screen fan mail and pick what gets read in the show. During recording, they assist the personality as a sort of sounding board, staying with them inside the booth while providing direction, correction and clarification when necessary. They provide valuable feedback especially in solo recordings and pre-recorded shows where there is no live audience to react to. Because of the nature of the role, their presence is often felt since you will usually hear them in the background. They also design the timetable that frames the entire show, which is fairly strict and requires certain elements. For example, a 30 minute program is not just the personality speaking: 1 minute each for the opening and closing. 8 minutes for mail. 15 for the main segment (2 minutes for explanation). 5 minutes for breaks and commercials.
